# Carlos Toxtli Hernandez website
This is my personal website hosted in GitHub Pages.

## How I did it?

I decided to update my CV from a Google Docs document, so I linked the public web URL from Google Docs and retrieved the HTML content via an AJAX call. This is a very simple integration but makes my life easier. I recommend people to do it, is pretty convenient.

## Dynamic version

I know that the flat format is not very attractive, this is why I developed a tool that is able to turn any Google Docs document into a modern website. You can try it in this URL: http://www.carlostoxtli.com/docs2web/ .

Take a look to my resume using the tool https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.carlostoxtli.com/docs2web/%23url%3Dhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRzOcmxi_cktmaHhyNufzci3c27HYIeAy3Zep026Va6PFbnpXIAzs6WDkHNoyjuLWuo1DtZEM0GTCMm/pub&sa=D&ust=1546973882695000

I also want to encourage people to contribute to that tool, we can do something great together.
