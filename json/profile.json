        "DESCRIPTION": "Online bots are quickly becoming important collaborators with humans in tackling issues in healthcare, politics, and even activism. Recently, non-profits have used many bots in place of their human members to scaffold collaborations with citizens. However, this shift invites new challenges: it is difficult for outsiders to understand the joint effort that bots have now initiated with humans, limiting the goals reached collectively. To help non-profits coordinate the volunteers recruited by online bots, we propose BotViz. BotViz is a new online platform that via data visualizations provides outsiders a clear understanding of the interactions of bots with volunteers.\nOur data visualization presents two benefits related to traditional interfaces: 1) Diversity, wherein people can understand the diversity of the volunteers, especially their unique strengths; 2) Stalling, wherein people who may be delaying the collective effort triggered by bots can be easily identified by volunteers. Together, our data visualizations point to a future where humans and online bots\ncan better collaborate in order to have large scale impact."

        "DESCRIPTION": "Crowdsourcing marketplaces provide opportunities for autonomous and collaborative professional work as well as social engagement. However, in these marketplaces, workers feel disrespected due to unreasonable rejections and low payments, whereas requesters do not trust the results they receive.\nThe lack of trust and uneven distribution of power among workers and requesters have raised serious concerns about sustainability of these marketplaces. To address the challenges of trust and power, this paper introduces Daemo, a self-governed crowdsourcing marketplace.\nWe propose a prototype task to improve the work quality and open-governance model to achieve equitable representation. We envisage Daemo will enable workers to build sustainable careers and\nprovide requesters with timely, quality labor for their businesses."

        "DESCRIPTION": "Users of social networks can be passionate about sharing their political convictions, art projects, or business ventures. They often want to direct their social interactions to certain people in order to start collaborations or to raise awareness about issues they support. However, users generally have scattered, unstructured information about the characteristics of their audiences, making it difficult for them to deliver the right messages or interactions to the right people.\nExisting audience-targeting tools allow people to select potential candidates based on predefined lists, but the tools provide few insights about whether or not these people would be appropriate for a specific type of communication.\nWe introduce an online tool, Hax, to explore instead the idea of using interactive data visualizations to help people dynamically identify audiences for their different sharing efforts. We provide the results of a preliminary empirical evaluation that shows the strength of the idea and points to areas for future research."

        "DESCRIPTION": "We present a novel social interactive system that brings music creation to the crowds. It allows anyone with a personal electronic device and regardless of their musical expertise to participate in the music an orchestra generates, while also encouraging social interactions among participants. Users can be either musicians or conductors. The latter drive the group's music production, while the others follow simple game-like instructions on their device for playing the conductor's selected songs. The primary mode of interaction for playing songs, consists of rotating one's electronic device in different ways. Our system also provides different social interaction cues that aim for novice and expert users to start conversations with each other and improve the group's performance as well as construct a community among participants. We report on a qualitative analysis, which suggests that users appreciate the system's versatility in providing service to a variety of devices and enjoy participating in the orchestra with their own personal device. Users judged the social interaction cues the system provided to be effective. We believe our findings aid the design of future social intelligent environments that seek to build communities with participants through music."

We have integrated the 3D position sensor to our existing gesture therapy system of computer simulated therapy exercises. We have also used pitch, yaw, and roll, from the Wii remote 3D accelerometer to navigate a fly-through of an arbitrary Direct-X generated terrain. The hardware-based orientation and motion sensing capabilities of the Wii remote complement vision-based systems and interface well with wrist exercises. It is conceivable to reduce the size of the technology such that each finger could have one or more accelerometers mounted with wireless communication. The Wii remote model is promising for integration into clinical and home-based rehabilitation exercise therapy systems."
